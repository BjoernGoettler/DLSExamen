# Fault-Isolative Architectures

### Initiatives

- Split services on the Y-axis (see [Scalability Cube](4_SCALABILITY_CUBE.md))
    - Isolate swimlanes
- Communicate asynchronous between swimlanes (see [Asynchronous Design](5_ASYNCHRONOUS_DESIGN.md))
- Make resilience strategies to to immitigate BrokenCircuits etc.

### Demo

PingerService survives if PongerService goes down
