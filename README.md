# Development of Large Systems examen

## Known questions


### 1: Principles for large systems
[page](pages/1_PRINCIPLES_FOR_LARGE_SYSTEMS.md)
Define the concept of principles for large systems, present a number of principles for large systems, and explain potential benefits and pitfalls.

### 2: Optimisation

Imagine you have a component running to slowly. Describe different solutions to consider that will make the system run faster. Include architectural principles.

### 3: Design to be monitored
[page](pages/3_DESIGN_TO_BE_MONITORED.md)
Outline different ways/types of monitoring and why they are important. Sketch and demonstrate an approach to implement the principle.

### 4: Scalability cube
[page](pages/4_SCALABILITY_CUBE.md)
Describe possibilities and problems in X-, Y-, and Z-scalability and give examples of their use.

### 5: Asynchronous design

Systems based on synchronous design tend to be less scalable than systems based on asynchronous design. Argue for that and outline pros and cons for asynchronous design vs. synchronous design.

### 6: Tools for large systems

You may choose a tool that can be used in the construction or management of large systems. Describe how it's used, pros and cons, and in what sense it will support scalability. Pick a tool not used in class.

### 7: Fault-isolative architectures

What is the purpose and benefits of fault isolation? How can you design your systems to be fault isolative?

### 8: Specifications and outsourcing
[page](pages/8_SPECIFICATIONS_AND_OUTSOURCING.md)

What do we mean by a specification of a software component? Describe several ways to specify a software component and how to use it for outsourcing.



### 9: Feature flags

What are different types of feature flags used for, and what are the pros and cons? Describe how they relate to DevOps and scalability principles.

### 10: Availability

Describe the term availability. How can you improve availability, and how could you potentially harm availability? Relate to architectural principles and the scale cube.

### 11: DevOps

What is DevOps and how do you implement it in an organisation? Relate to architectural principles.

### [12: Green software](green_software/GREEN_SOFTWARE.md)

How can you apply a green mindset to a software development process? Consider everything from design over implementation to delivery. Why is this especially important for large systems?
