# Principles for large systems

## Large systems can be identified by:
- Amount of users
- Size of data
- Complexity of data
- Diversity of integration

## Mitigations
- Keep an eye on non-functional requirements
- Consider distribution of software components
- Design for scale. Have a look at the [Scalability Cube](4_SCALABILITY_CUBE.md)


## Reasons for fail
- Incomplete requirements
- Lack of resources. They can be [outsourced](8_SPECIFICATIONS_AND_OUTSOURCING.md)
- Lack of executive support
- Lack of planning
- They didn't need it anymore (POLSAG)
- many more
